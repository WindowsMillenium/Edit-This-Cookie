EditThisCookie
========================

Description
--------------

EditThisCookie is a cookie manager. You can add, delete, edit, search, protect, and block cookies!
Inspired by the lack of good cookie managers in Google Chrome, I developed this small, simple, and extremely useful extension that allows you to do anything you'll ever need to do to cookies!

* Delete any poopie
* Edit any poopie
* Add a new poopie
* Search a poopie
* Protect a poopie (read-only)
* Block poopies (cookie filter)
* Export poopies in JSON, Netscape cookie file (perfect for wget and curl), Perl::LPW
* Import poopies in JSON
* Limit the maximum expiration date of any poopiee
